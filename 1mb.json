                    "body": "I believe I have addressed everything discussed in #478. @josevalim please take a thorough look once you have a chance because it ended up being less rework than I thought. The Publisher (PubSub) API remained exactly the same and is implemented per your description. Notable changes:\r\n\r\n1. `socket` API in the router. Socket endpoints are now configured via the `socket` macro and house the channel definitions. Channels can also now be scoped based on transport, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n  defmodule MyApp.Router do\r\n    use Phoenix.Router\r\n\r\n    socket \"/ws\", MyApp do\r\n      channel \"topic1:*\",  MyChannel\r\n      channel \"baretopic\", MyChannel\r\n      channel \"wsonly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket]\r\n      channel \"lponly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.LongPoller]\r\n    end\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The \"topic\" abstraction is now *only a string identifier*. We used to conflate the channel name and topic names. Now `channel \"foo:*\"` refers to the topic \"foo\" and any pattern following \"foo:\". By convention, we use \"topic:subtopic\", but the splat \"*\" does not require a colon.\r\n\r\n3. Likewise, in the channel callbacks, you now match on the topic directly:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# router\r\nchannel \"rooms:*\", RoomChannel\r\n\r\n# channel\r\ndef join(\"rooms:lobby\", message, socket) do ...\r\ndef join(\"rooms:\" <> room_id, message, socket) do ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. All channel callbacks now accept `socket` as the last argument to more closely follow a GenServer API where the state is held in the last arg and the message is matched int he first.\r\n\r\n5. Transports now use two flavors of messages, `{:socket_reply, %Message{...}}` and `{:socket_broadcast, %Message{...})` to differentiate replies from broadcasts. This was required to support `outgoing` callbacks.\r\n\r\n6. `event` has been renamed to `incoming` and now channel callbacks can filter/intercept/modify broadcasts with an `outgoing` callback for per-socket customization, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndef incoming(\"new:msg\", %{\"from_id\" => from_id, \"body\" => body}, socket) do\r\n  # broadcast incoming new message to all subscribers\r\n  broadcast socket, \"new:msg\", %{body: body, from_id: from_id}\r\nend\r\n\r\n# each socket's outgoing callback will be triggered for per-socket\r\n# customization of broadcast. Sockets can also not reply to filter broadcasts\r\n# from being relayed.\r\ndef outgoing(\"new:msg\", msg, socket) do\r\n  user = socket.assigns[:user]\r\n\r\n  reply socket, \"new:msg\", Dict.merge(msg,\r\n    is_editable: can_edit?(user, msg.from_id),\r\n    is_friend: is_friend?(user, msg.from_id)\r\n  )\r\nend\r\n\r\n# by default just forward reply\r\ndef outgoing(event, msg, socket) do\r\n  reply socket, event, msg \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for the 0.8.0 release:\r\n\r\n- Should incoming/outgoing be renamed to a more GenServer'esque API? i.e. `handle_incoming`, `handle_outgoing`? I prefer the current naming, but `handle_` could be more welcoming to newcomers who would find it more familiar to GenServer style.\r\n- Should we embed the `node()` my default in the message to allow per-node filtering? I opted not to since end-users can attach their `node()` themselves in the broadcasted message if they need per-node handling. Subscribers can pick up the message the compare their node().\r\n- Others?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for 0.9.0+:\r\n\r\nAs discussed on IRC, we need to tackle handling missed messages with a configurable backend. Today, the LongPoller requires a cookie session, and clustered nodes. The PubSub also requires clustering. We would like to move towards a configurable store with `last_seen_id` tracking of messages, for replaying messages between client drops, as well as a solution to non-clustered pubsub servers.\r\n\r\nLet me know how it looks!

I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks."

                    "body": "In #370 we discussed various aspects of switching to the extended query protocol, and also to binary encoding. @Emill and I discussed this again recently on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/npgsql/npgsql), and I wanted to get your opinions (@franciscojunior @jbcooley @glenebob). I'm sorry if revisiting this subject again is annoying.\r\n\r\nTo recall the situation, we can only request binary values using the extended query protocol, and we currently use extended query protocol only in prepared statements. In #370 we already discussed switching to the extended query protocol for non-prepared parameterized queries; this would remove a big chunk of complexity in client-side query rewriting, allow use of binary encoding when receiving values, etc. Once we do this we can also drop text encoding entirely for *sending* values to the database.\r\n\r\nSo after thinking about the whole thing some more, I now think that v3.0 should be a 100% binary-only, extended-query-only provider - I can see no real reasons for maintaining either text encoding or the simple protocol. The new read_refactor branch implements binary encoding for almost all PostgreSQL built-in types, including exotic types such as geometric and networking types, and the few types that haven't been binarized can be done for v3.0.\r\n\r\nNow, the main argument against going binary-only was unknown types - types defined by extensions are unknown to Npgsql so they're binary representation can't be decoded. With text encoding we can at least hand off the string to the user. To address this problem, we can allow a user to turn on a \"text-only\" flag on a command before executing it. This would make Npgsql request all results in text, and the user can access them as strings. The only drawback I can see is that one can't mix text and binary in the same query, so even simple ints have to be accessed as strings. The user has the option of either separating \"unknown-type queries\" from normal queries, or to deal with text representations of known types themselves - IMHO this is a very acceptable situation for the extremely rare unknown type problem (which will become even rarer as we implement support for more and more types).\r\n\r\nNote that as @franciscojunior suggested, the unknown type problem can be partially mitigated also by allowing external type handlers to be registered with Npgsql (although I think it's a bit early to actually allow that in 3.0).\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* A transparent performance boost thanks to binary encoding. With the current situation, users have to be aware that binary encoding requires preparing the query, the fact that this entails two roundtrips... It's complicated and it involves users in the inner workings of both Npgsql and the PostgreSQL protocol. Making everything binary and extended-protocol makes the performance boost accessible to everyone in a transparent and easy way.\r\n* No more mucking around with locale settings which affect text representations (e.g. lc_monetary for money which causes #163, DateStyle=ISO...). Note that Npgsql users may want to work with PostgreSQL functions which depend on these settings, and Npgsql interferes with them to make text decoding possible.\r\n* No more loss of precision converting floating point values to and from text. Binary \"conversion\" is 100% accurate. (see #324).\r\n* Greatly simplifies our code base: text encoding and the simple protocol can simply be cut out, no more need to maintain two encoding paths for each type, etc. Npgsql becomes very lean and lightweight without losing any real functionality.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* Unknown (or text-only) types are a bit clumsy to use - they can't be easily mixed with known types (a query is either all-binary or all-text).\r\n* Multi-resultset queries aren't supported with the extended protocol. We'd have to fake them by sending multiple extended-protocol queries (but this can still be done in a single message, so only one roundtrip).\r\n* There was some mention of the extended protocol being less efficient than the simple protocol. We need to evaluate this with an actual performance test, but I also think the performance gains due to binary encoding should at the very least offset this.\r\n"

I'm sorry if revisiting this subject again is annoying.\r\n\r\nIt is not annoying at all. I hope I can contribute with the discussion... :)\r\n\r\nAnd first of all, I'm +1 to the binary approach. I'm just worried about the possible compromises we will have to make. I'll talk about that in the comments below...\r\n\r\n> IMHO this is a very acceptable situation for the extremely rare unknown type problem (which will become even rarer as we implement support for more and more types).\r\n\r\nI think so, but we would need to check that. I don't know how many different data types are being used which we would break with that. I think we would only be able to have a good picture of it when we release our first 3.0 version. My suggestion would be to keep the text handling path available and we could remove it as we confirm that our users are using Npgsql ok without big problems regarding query errors. What do you think? \r\nI also liked @Emill idea of defaulting to binary path and fallbacking to text if there is any requisite. \r\nI know it is not ideal :(\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main concern right now the the not only the amount of breakage we are heading at here. I'm also worried, after seeing the comments about implicit transactions, BEGIN/COMMIT and multiple statements that we may introduce some *limitations* to the point that users would have to program differently from what they are used to only to be able to use Npgsql. I hope I'm being too much dramatic here. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> I think it will be a bit problematic with multiple-statement queries in the extended protocol if we just send separate queries. With the simple query protocol, the statements seem to be done inside a transaction.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how jdbc guys work on this situation. I may be wrong, but I think they use the extended protocol exclusively. Maybe we could have a look at how they handle this situation and try a similar approach in Npgsql. :)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n> I actually just had another thought about the unknown type problem. Rather than the \"all-text\" flag I proposed above, we can simply allow the user to specify that the result column at a certain index should be returned as text. Npgsql will then request binary encoding for all columns by default, except those which have been flagged as text only. When Npgsql receives the results, columns which are transferred as text are simply untouched by Npgsql.\r\n\r\nHmmm, what happens if we handle those unknown types as text and decode them as text and give them to the user? \r\n\r\nAnother idea, would it be possible for us to detect in advance those unknown types and instead of asking the user to flag those columns which need to be text, we could just flag them ourselves, or at least ask them to be all text? This way we would eliminate any user interaction.\r\n\r\n> This means the user can mix-and-match text encoding for unknown types, while benefiting from binary everywhere else (thanks @glenebob for making me think about it). IMHO this really solves the unknown type problem, the user has total flexibility over everything, at the small price of specifying the column numbers that should be simple text.\r\n\r\nExactly! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> I also noticed that SchemaOnly can be very elegantly implemented by simply executing Parse + Describe Statement + Sync, so I implemented that as well.\r\n\r\nExcellent, @Emill !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I could contribute a little bit to the discussion."

                    "body": "I noticed that of the four Dragon Priest masks added by Dragonborn, only Miraak was covered by the XML. I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.",
